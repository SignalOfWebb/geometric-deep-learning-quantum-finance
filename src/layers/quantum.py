"""Quantum Layer: Density Matrix Regime Detection.

Detects market regimes by building data-conditioned density matrices
and extracting regime probabilities through the Born rule. Uses
Cholesky factorisation for valid density matrices and the Cayley
transform for learnable unitary evolution.

Theoretical Context:
    Market regimes are modeled as quantum density matrices to capture uncertainty
    and mixed states (Haven & Khrennikov, 2013). We use Cholesky decomposition
    (Ma et al., 2021) to ensure physical validity (positive semi-definite, unit trace)
    and the Cayley transform (Kiani et al., 2022) to learn unitary state transitions
    without vanishing gradients, reading out probabilities via the Born rule.
