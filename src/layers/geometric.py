"""Geometric Layer: Hypersphere Embedding for financial features.

Maps raw financial features onto the surface of a unit hypersphere so
that directional relationships between stocks are preserved. All
manifold operations (projection, distances, exponential/logarithmic
maps, Frechet mean) are implemented in pure PyTorch.

Theoretical Context:
    Standard Euclidean space fails to capture the latent geometry of financial
    markets. Following Wang & Isola (2020), we project features to a unit
    hypersphere to ensure Uniformity (preventing collapse) and Alignment
    (preserving similarity). We use Riemannian geometry (Bronstein et al., 2021)
    to perform rigorous operations (distances, means) on this curved surface.
