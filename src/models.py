"""Integrated Geometric-Quantum-Graph model for financial prediction.

Combines hypersphere embedding, correlation-graph message passing, and regime-aware
gating with a per-node head. Inputs follow the flat PyTorch Geometric layout:
``(total_nodes, D)`` features and a ``batch`` vector, so a full mini-batch is one
vectorised forward pass.

    Data flows through five stages:
        1. Geometric: raw features are projected onto a hypersphere.
        2. Graph: GNN aggregates information across correlated stocks.
        3. Quantum: pooled embeddings + yield curve context produce
           regime probabilities via a density matrix.
        4. Fusion: regime probabilities gate the graph output so the
           prediction is regime-aware.
        5. Prediction: a small MLP outputs a log return forecast.

    Args:
        feature_dim: Input feature dimension per stock (D).
